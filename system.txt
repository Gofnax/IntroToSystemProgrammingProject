What Year Was Pacman Released?
I tried to google it, but then I became too lazy and gave up. So can anybody answer it?

What's Up with Gamestop?
Haven't seen a store of them in a long time. Are they still in business?

I think they closed. There was a story about playing with their stocks or something.

Recipe for Banana Bread
Hi! I tried yesterday making some banana bread, but apparently just trying to shove a banana into a loaf of bread isn't the recipe. Does some1 have a better one?

Maybe try making the dough yourself and mixing it with banana?
